    Imagine a single particle in a one-dimensional
    world, whose velocity equals its position; at $t = 0$,
    the particle is sitting at $x = 1$:

    If we play time backward, will the particle 
    ever reach $x = 0$? 

    |> Solution

        Going back in time,
        examine how long it would take

        _Note 1._
        We never took the time to prove the associativity
        of function addition, but it is easy to prove! 
        (For other proofs see Exercise 32, Exercise 33, as
        well as Exercise 9, Chapter 3.)
