    Apply the definition
    
    $$
    fg = (u \ra f(u)g(u))
    $$
    
    of function multiplication
    in order to show that

    $$
    (fg)h = f(gh)
    $$

    for all functions $f, g, h : \rr \ra \rr$,
    or, namely, to show that

    __($f$ times $g$) times $h$__

    equals

    __$f$ times ($g$ times $h$)__

    for all functions $f, g, h : \rr \ra \rr$.

    |> Solution

        It is necessary and sufficient to show that
        
        $$
        ((fg)h)(u)
        $$
        
        is the same as
        
        $$
        (f(gh))(u)
        $$
        
        for an arbitrary input $u \in \rr$, in order to
        show that 
        
        $$
        (fg)h
        $$
        
        and
        
        $$
        f(gh)
        $$
        
        are the same function. (Function equality is
        based on input-output behavior: two functions are
        equal if and only if every input is mapped to the
        same output under either function. See Note 6,
        Exercise 9, Chapter 3.)

        Starting up,
        
        $$
        ((fg)h)(u) = (fg)(u) \cdot h(u)
        $$
        
        by the definition of function multiplication,
        and
        
        $$
        (f(gh))(u) = f(u) \cdot (gh)(u)
        $$
        
        likewise. Moreover,
        
        $$
        (fg)(u) = f(u) \cdot g(u)
        $$
        
        and
        
        $$
        (gh)(u) = g(u) \cdot h(u)
        $$
        
        by the same definition again. Therefore,
        
        $$
        ((fg)h)(u) = (f(u) \cdot g(u)) \cdot h(u)
        $$
        
        on the one hand, and
        
        $$
        (f(gh))(u) = f(u) \cdot (g(u) \cdot h(u))
        $$
        
        on the other hand. But
        
        $$
        (f(u) \cdot g(u)) \cdot h(u) = f(u) \cdot (g(u) \cdot h(u))
        $$
        
        by the associativity of ordinary real number
        multiplication. (Not function multiplication:
        _real number multiplication_.) So
        
        $$
        ((fg)h)(u)
        $$
        
        equals
        
        $$
        (f(gh))(u)
        $$
        
        for arbitrary $u$, which completes the proof.

        |> Pause
        _Note 1._
        In words, we have just established the
        
        __associativity of function multiplication__
        
        while we had previously established the

        __associativity of function composition__

        (if you recall that one) in Exercise 9 of Chapter 
        3.

        |> Pause
        _Note 2._
        By this result, we can write
        
        $$
        fgh
        $$
        
        without any parentheses at all: 
        it doesn't matter whether we think of this 
        product as $(fg)h$ or $f(gh)$, the result 
        is the same.
